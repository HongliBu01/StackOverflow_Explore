##Web Crawler System

### Usage:
For crawler_seq.go:
go run crawler_seq.go <file>
	file = the input file name(place the file to the folder of crawler_seq.go
	before running the program)

For crawler_para.go:
go run crawler_para.go <file> <threads>
	file = the input file name(place the file to the folder of crawler_seq.go
	before running the program)
	threads = the number of threads(including the main thread)

### Notice:

1.  As this is a web crawler for stackoverflow, please keep in mind that stackoverflow is
monitoring unusual high number of requests. If you run the programe frequently or run against
with large file, your ip will be temporarily rate limited, then you will get empty or partial results. 
	*If you want to check the correctness,just run against a small file(may be 10 urls)
	*If you want to do timing, you may need to run and wait for a while, or use different ip
2. They are question numbers don't really exist in stackoverflow now, and this will cause a redirection. So the result may not be consistent with ground truth data.

I am so sorry for the inconvience, but i think this is the common problem for web crawler.
Hope you can enjoy it!
