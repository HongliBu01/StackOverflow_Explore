Google Cloud server will shut down by January 2019!

### Overview

My project focuses on doing interesting analysis and statistics of stackoverflow data. This is initial version, I finished batch layer, serve layer and speed layer.
Here are my urls:

http://35.225.120.103:3192/excellent-users.html
http://35.225.120.103:3192/best-questions.html
http://35.225.120.103:3192/submit-vote.html


### Data source

I got the data from Bigquery public datasets. Here is the link:https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=mpcs53013-2018&p=bigquery-public-data&d=stackoverflow&page=dataset.
The CSV file size is about 4.7 GB.

### Batch view

See `hql` folder for all `.hql` files.

I created my batch views in the following steps:

- Run `posts_questions.hql, posts_answers.hql, posts_users.hql, posts_tag.hql` to load all stackoverflow data into hive.

- Run `excellent_users.hql` to get users who has highest reputation in stackoverflow.

- Run `best_questions_2018.hql` to extract questions with highest scores and corresponding answers between 2008 to 2018. (when running it, just change 'year' field to get info for different years )

- Run `active_users.hql` to sort users according to their answer amount.

- Run `popular_tags.hql` to find tags and their occurrences.

### Hbase

I wrote hive tables to Hbase in the following steps:

- Run `hbase_excellent_users.hql` to  generate hbase table `honglibu_hbase_excellent_users`.

- Run `hbase_best_questions_2018.hql` to generate hbase tables  `honglibu_hbase_best_questions_xxxx`.


### Web interface

See `honglibu_web_app` folder for sources codes of web interces.

##### html:

- `excellent-users.html` displays a form for user to search excellent stackoverflow users with a certain ranking.
- `best-questions.html` displays a form for user to search best questions with a certain ranking and year.


### Speed Layer

In Kafka I created topic `honglibu_active_users` to listen to recent votes for top10 active users of Stack Overflow.

You may use http://35.225.120.103:3192/submit-vote.html to vote for the users

For speed layer table, I created a `honglibu_hbase_active_users` table in hbase.

```
hbase(main):003:0> create 'honglibu_hbase_active_users', 'users'
```
